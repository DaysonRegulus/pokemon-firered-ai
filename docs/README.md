# Pokémon FireRed AI Agent

An AI agent trained to play Pokémon FireRed using the Stable-Baselines3 reinforcement learning framework.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Train reinforcement learning (RL) agents capable of playing Pokémon FireRed effectively, using visual feedback and emulator RAM values as reward signals.

## 🧠 Agent Overview

This project uses a CNN-based policy to train the agent, with reward signals engineered from:

- Visual exploration (new areas discovered)
- Pokémon leveling up
- Fainting events (self and opponent)
- Real-time battle statistics (HP, level, etc.)

These signals are derived from direct memory (RAM) reads of the emulator.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project, simply execute:

```bash
python FireRedRender.py
```
This will start the training process (or load an existing pre-trained model if available).

All environment setup (gym, stable-retro, reward manager) is handled internally. The script runs in a compact form, assuming dependencies are already installed.

## 🖥️ Environment

- WSL Ubuntu

- Virtual Environment (venv)

- Python 3.10+

- GPU Acceleration (CUDA supported)

## 🔁 Workflow

- Parallelized environments for faster training

- Reward management via RAM data

- Model checkpoints for resuming training
